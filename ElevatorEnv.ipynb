The objective is to pick up passengers from various floors and deliver them to the first floor. New passengers may arrive at each floor while the elevator is in operation. The elevator can move up and down, and pick up and drop off passengers. However, it can only do so when the door is open, and it can only move when the door is closed.\n",

    "- Value 6: A value of 0 or 1 indicating the direction of the elevator (0 for down, 1 for up).\n",
    "- Value 7: A value of 0 or 1 indicating whether the elevator door is open (1) or closed (0).\n",
    "- Values 8-12: One-hot encoding of the current floor of the elevator. For example, if the elevator is at floor 0, then value 8 is 1, and the rest are 0.\n",
